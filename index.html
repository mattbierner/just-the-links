</figure>

<p>Wikipedia is an internet encyclopedia developed by humans fourteen billion years after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang">universe began</a>. Humans are mid-sized terrestrial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal">animals</a> characterized by erect posture, tool use, and large brains.<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup> They are found exclusively on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</a>, a small rocky planet orbiting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-type_main-sequence_star">G-type main sequence star</a> called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun">The Sun</a>.<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup> A year is the orbital period of the Earth about The Sun.</p>

<p>The Sun is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup> The Sun is scheduled to explode in four billion years.<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup> This is generally understood to be a bad thing by animals living on Earth.</p>

<h3 id="the-development-of-encyclopedias">Encyclopedias</h3>

<p>Most humans orbit the Sun fifty to eighty times before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death">terminating biological function</a>.<sup><a href="#6">[6]</a></sup> Most humans would like to orbit the Sun many more times, and spend their fifty to eighty orbits trying to do so. There have been no confirmed successes.<sup><a href="#7">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>Two thousand years after the human called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus">Jesus</a> terminated his biological function, another human called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> created Wikipedia. Wikipedia is an internet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>. An encyclopedia is an external collection of human knowledge expressed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol">symbols</a>.<sup><a href="#8">[8]</a></sup> Humans communicate with symbols because their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain">brains</a> cannot talk directly to each other.<sup><a href="#">[9]</a></sup> This fact, combined with biological function termination angst, is the primary cause of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War">conflict within human society</a>.</p>

<p>Some humans had brains that said Jesus had been a very good human and some humans had brains that said he was not so good as the other humans claimed.<sup><a href="#">[9]</a></sup><sup><a href="#">[10]</a></sup> Most humans had brains that said encyclopedias were very good.</p>

<h3 id="the-development-of-bombs">Bombs</h3>

<figure class="image">  
    <img src="/img/a_bomb.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>A bomb that can terminate the biological function of lots of humans.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Humans used to print encyclopedias on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper">mashed up dead plants</a>. But all those dead plants were very heavy and difficult to move around <sup><a href="#">[]</a></sup>. By this time, humans had also become very good at terminating the biological function of other humans with energy machines called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb">bombs</a>. Energy is a property of objects which can be transferred to other objects.<sup><a href="#">[]</a></sup>
</p>


<p>The Sun and bombs both transfer energy. Bombs are much smaller than the Sun <sup><a href="#">[]</a></sup> but make up for this by transferring their energy very quickly and very near by. When a bomb transfers enough energy to a human, the human terminates biological function. Rapid energy transfer also turns mashed up plant encyclopedias to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcoal">charcoal</a> by way of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion">high-temperature exothermic redox chemical reaction</a>.<sup><a href="#">[]</a></sup></p>

<p>Some other humans called scientists soon made bombs that were so big that they were afraid that all their encyclopedias would be turned into charcoal. This would be bad because without encyclopedias no one would remember the scientists after they terminated biological function. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego">Being remembered</a> was considered the second best thing to being alive. <sup><a href="#">[]</a></sup></p>

<p>So the scientists developed a system to encode the symbols that made up their encyclopedias <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics">using switches</a>. They also made machines called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computers</a> that could flip these switches very quickly. Scientists connected all the computers with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire">long metal threads</a> that allowed the computers to flip each other’s switches too. This was called the Internet. <sup><a href="#">[]</a></sup> Even a very large bomb cannot destroy all the computers on the internet.<sup>[citation-needed]</sup></p>

</figure>

<p>The human called Jimmy Wales used the Internet to create Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a computer that lets humans who are not Jimmy Wales change its switches too <sup><a href="#">[]</a></sup>. Humans liked Wikipedia and wrote encyclopedia articles on everything, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BK_Chicken_Fries">BK Chicken Fries</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide">Cambodian Genocide</a>.</p>

<p>BK Chicken Fries are strands of mashed up dead <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken">chicken</a> sold as food on Earth by a restaurant called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King">Burger King</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food">Food</a> is a substance that animals consume for energy and to continue their biological functioning.<sup><a href="#">[]</a></sup> Humans are animals and must consume food. Humans are also made of food but are not considered good food by most other humans.<sup><a href="#">[]</a></sup> Food transfers energy much slower than bombs.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia article on BK Chicken Fries was four thousand words long. The Wikipedia article on the Cambodian Genocide was two thousand words long. Two million humans were told they could no longer orbit The Sun during the Cambodian Genocide.</p>

<h3 id="link-theory">History</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)">Reading</a> Wikipedia took a long time because it was very big. But all the content on Wikipedia was connected together by special <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue">blue</a> words called hyperlinks. The Wikipedia article on BK Chicken Fries had five hundred blue words linking to articles such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR">NASCAR</a> and MySpace. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace">MySpace</a> was also an Internet computer that anyone could flip switches on, but humans didn’t like it anymore and made fun of it.</p>

<p>Many humans had brains that said the blue words were very good. Many humans only read the blue words. Scientists used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science">science</a> to show that nothing was lost by only reading the blue words.</p>

<p>A human called Matt Bierner also thought that the blue words were very good and wanted other humans to like the blue words as much as he did. So he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">flipped many switches on his computer</a> until Wikipedia only showed the blue words. He called the new computer <i>Just the Links</i> and was so proud of it that he shared it with other humans. He also posted snarky text about his creation on the Internet to make himself look clever. This was known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service">social networking</a>. Social networking was very popular.</p> 

<h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Just the Links shows only blue text in a Wikipedia article. Any black words that match the blue words are also considered blue. All the black words are replaced with underlines. Just the Links tries to make articles look the same after the black words are replaced.</p>

<p>Just the Links works with the Chrome web browser. Humans use web browsers to view the Internet and a company called Google created Chrome in order to show Internet advertisements more quickly. Advertisements tell humans what to do with money. Money is an item that can be exchanged for goods and services. Around Google money was made from compressed plant seeds. Google had lots of money.</p>
